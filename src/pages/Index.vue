      </h3>

      <p class="leading-normal text-md lg:text-xl mb-8">
        With your help we can put on our inaugural conference at PHPWales, bringing together 400
developers from around the world. Spread over 2 days in the capital city of Wales (Cardiff).
Hosted in the Cardiff City Hall be sure to come along for the chance to learn from some of
the best in the industry.
With this being our first run, we wanted to set the theme to ensure the message was clear.
Our theme is community, inclusion, and the importance of these. We have all seen when a
community goes bad, or individuals are excluded from a community for one reason or
another. We want to remind people that we are all one community of developers - but for
these 2 days we are uniting under the banner of PHP.

        Our Tracks
      </h3>

      <h4 class="my-4 text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold leading-tight">API Track</h4>
      <p class="leading-normal text-md lg:text-xl mb-8">
        The API track is dedicated to all things API, from OpenAPI specifications, to JSON:API
schema to how to build a microservice with the beautiful Slim4 this track is for your
      </p>

      <h4 class="my-4 text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold leading-tight">Tooling and Language Track</h4>
      <p class="leading-normal text-md lg:text-xl mb-8">
        The Tooling and Language Track is the track that covers pretty much anything not covered
in the other track, something of a catch all. From MySQL8 to how to utilise PHP7.4 and
beyond. If you want to give a more general tech talk, or a talk that doesnâ€™t fall into the
unConf or API track this is the track for you.
      </p>

      <h4 class="my-4 text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold leading-tight">unConf Track</h4>
      <p class="leading-normal text-md lg:text-xl mb-8">
        The unConf track is a track dedicated to lightning talks and panel discussions, this is where
        we will hear a lot of different talks (on any technology subject) and have discussions on
        larger subjects.

        PHPWales is a new conference and is an attempt to bring together all developers under the
        banner of PHP for the day to learn some cool new things, but also strengthen the community
        and promote inclusion. The theme for our first conference is community and inclusion, we
        want to stress the importance of community for developers and how important inclusion is for
        a community.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-normal text-md lg:text-xl mb-8">
        This is the first PHP conference in Wales, and we aim to set the standards for what a
        conference should be and how it should operate. All while allowing us to provide an
        incredible learning opportunity and conference experience. And for that, we cannot thank
        you enough.
